# Cloud Service Broker
An OSBAPI-compliant service broker that uses Terraform to create service instances.

This is a service broker built to be used with [Cloud Foundry](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html) and Kubernetes. It adheres to the [Open Service Broker API v2.13](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md).

Cloud Service Broker is a fork of the [GCP Service Broker](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcp-service-broker) and uses [Brokerpaks](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud-service-broker/blob/main/docs/brokerpak-intro.md) to expose services. As long as your target cloud has a [Terraform provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html), services can be provisioned via a common interface using standard `cf` CLI commands.

Some of the benefits over traditional, IaaS-provided, service brokers include: 
- **Easily extensible and maintainable** Less talking to far-flung teams, more getting work done. 
- **One common broker for all brokered services.** Cloud Service Broker decouples the service broker functionality from the catalog of services that it exposes.
- **Credhub integration out-of-the-box** CredHub encrypts and manages all the secrets associated with your usage of cloud services.
- **Community** When you expose a service via a [Brokerpak](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud-service-broker/blob/main/docs/brokerpak-intro.md), you can make it available to everyone who uses CSB.
- **Possible to migrate existing services using [TF Import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/index.html)**

## Installation

This service broker can be installed as a CF application. See the instructions for:

* [General configuration](./docs/configuration.md)
* [AWS](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/csb-brokerpak-aws/blob/main/docs/aws-installation.md)
* [Azure](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/csb-brokerpak-azure/blob/main/docs/azure-installation.md)
  * [Azure configuration examples](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/csb-brokerpak-azure/blob/main/docs/azure-example-configs.md)
* [GCP](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/csb-brokerpak-gcp/blob/main/docs/installation.md)


## CSB-Provided Brokerpaks 

To examine, submit issues or pull requests to the Brokerpaks which have been created for the major public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) see the repos below:

* [AWS Brokerpak](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/csb-brokerpak-aws)
* [Azure Brokerpak](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/csb-brokerpak-azure)
* [GCP Brokerpak](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/csb-brokerpak-gcp)

## Usage

**For operators**: see [docs/configuration.md](./docs/configuration.md) for details about configuring the service broker.

**For developers**: see [docs/](./docs) ReadMe for service options and details.

You can get documentation specific to your install from the `/docs` endpoint of your deployment.


## Commands

The service broker can be run as both a server (the service broker) and as a general purpose command line utility.
It supports the following sub-commands:

 * `client` - A CLI client for the service broker.
 * `config` - Show and merge configuration options together.
 * `help` - Help about any command.
 * `serve` - Start the service broker.

## Development

`make` is used to orchestrate most development tasks. 
`go` is required to build the broker. If you don't have `go` installed, it is possible to use a `docker` image to build and unit test the broker. If the environment variable `USE_GO_CONTAINERS` exists, `make` will use `docker` versions of the tools so you don't need to have them installed locally. 

There are make targets for most common dev tasks. Running make without a target will list the possible targets.

| command           | action                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `make build`      | builds broker into `./build`           |
| `make test-units` | runs unit tests                        |
| `make clean`      | removes binaries and built broker paks |

## Local mimic commands
The mimic commands look and feel like CloudFoundry CLI commands, but actually run CSB actions locally. They are useful when developing brokerpaks.
By using the make target `make install` you can install the CSB as a local command called `csb`.
The mimic commands are:
- `csb create-service` - creates a service instance
- `csb services` - lists created service instances
- `csb update-service` - updates a serivce instance
- `csb delete-service` - deletes a service instance
- `csb create-service-key` - creates a "binding" and prints credentials
- `csb service-keys` - lists service keys
- `csb delete-service-key` - deletes a "binding"

The mimic commands build a brokerpak, start an ephemeral CSB server and send OSBAPI
requests to it in a similar style to what CloudFoundry would do. The CSB database
is stored as a file called `.csb.db`.

Additionally, there are commands which use the same framework to run the example tests. These are:
- `csb examples` - list the example tests
- `csb run-examples` - runs the specified example tests
