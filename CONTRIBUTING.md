# Contributing to Pivotal Projects

Weâ€™d love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. Please review the following guidelines you'll need to follow in order to make a contribution.

# Brokerpak Philosophy
We anticipate that many of the contributions we receive from the CSB Community will be Brokerpaks which expose new services to operators/developers through the Broker. Our friends at Google have done an awesome job putting together a concise explanation of what a Brokerpak is and the philosophy behind them, check it out [in the docs here.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud-service-broker/blob/master/docs/brokerpak-intro.md)

They've also put together some specifications which we will be aligning to (and modifying as needed). [The specs can be found here.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud-service-broker/blob/master/docs/brokerpak-specification.md)

## Unit + End-to-End Testing
